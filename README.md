version notes 0.01A
//////////////////////////////////

this is a zork clone and engine for anyone interseted in making their own zork clone, it still has a few missing features such as use and use item, i do not advise using at as a platform for your own project just yet


one of the big features of this engine is all of the different rooms are written as simple xml files and run through the engine, feel free to screw around with whatever you like
