////Ryan's Idea////////
you are rob champ. you are abducted from your bungalow and tossed in a locked cell in a labyrinth
you awake in a small room stripped to your rags and round glasses.

after touching the wall you find a loose stone and pull on it to escape from your jail cell
as you leave your cell you are confronted with a minotar, named Sweet Chez Jr.
you must talk to him and listen to his sob tale about his failed fast food franchise.
after that he will give you directions... if you chose to follow them you will die

going past the hallway with Chez you find a atrum full of venus fly traps, in the corner there are 
slabs of meat left there. if you throw meat for them they wont eat it though, you have to take off your
rags and throw the meat so they think its a person. only then can you sneak past the vicious plants

the final room has a suit of armour in it. you must put on the suit of armor and smash the wall down with
a mace to progress.




////Matt's Ideda//////
1 January, 2000, celebrity chef, Rob Champ finds himself to be the only man left standing in the hotel ballroom
at what was the most glamorous New Year's Eve party in the city. His insistence on wearing mediaeval garb
(we're unsure whether he thought it was a fancy dress party or what) saved his life when, at midnight, all the
pagers, discmans, and palm pilots in the room exploded, killing everyone. Rob has no memory of events preceding
Y2K, and must rely on his wits to find his way to safety - the streets are not safe, and Rob is not alone
